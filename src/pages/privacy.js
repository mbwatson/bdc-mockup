        <Title>Data and Participant Privacy Protection</Title>
 
        <Paragraph>
            In addition to its useful tools, applications, and workflows, NHLBI BioData Catalyst increases access to NHLBI datasets, allows researchers to bring their own data, and offers secure collaboration workspaces. BioData Catalyst, therefore, must responsibly steward access to hosted datasets, require researchers bringing their own data to respect and protect the interests of research participants, and take measures to secure the BioData Catalyst ecosystem.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading>All Users and All Data</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
            Whether working with hosted or their own data, users are always obligated to protect participant privacy and must follow <ExternalLink to="https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/genomic-data-sharing/">NIH policies for data protection</ExternalLink>. User institutions are accountable and may be subject to sanctions if policies are violated.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading>Hosted Data Access Controls</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
             All hosted data within BioData Catalyst is de-identified. Further restrictions on access and use are used as additional measures of security.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading>Authorization of Use</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
            Access to hosted data is controlled through the <ExternalLink to="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes</ExternalLink> (dbGaP) system by authorization of the appropriate Data Access Committee (DAC).
            Data Access Committees are established based on programmatic areas of interest as well as technical and ethical expertise.
            All DACs operate through common principles and under similar mechanisms to ensure the consistency and transparency of the controlled-data access process.
            Use of industry standard <ExternalLink to="https://oauth.net/">OAuth 2.0</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink to="https://openid.net/connect/">Open ID Connect</ExternalLink> (OIDC) services,
            which are connected to <ExternalLink to="https://era.nih.gov/">NIHâ€™s electronic Research Administration</ExternalLink> (eRA) infrastructure for authentication and authorization,
            ensures that only data objects approved for access by NIH DACs and approved in dbGaP are available to a user in BioData Catalyst.
        </Paragraph>
 
        <Heading>Access to Individual Level Data and Download Functionality</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
            All data transfers are made using standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted sessions. And users must be logged in with their eRA accounts to access individual level data or download any data (see below for details about downloading data).
        </Paragraph>
 
        <Heading>Data Download Restrictions</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
            Download capabilities are limited to metadata and analysis results, and the latter must comply with restrictions defined by NIH for <ExternalLink to="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-023.html">Summary Results</ExternalLink>. Downloading of sequences, variants, images, phenotypes and other individual data is prohibited. BioData Catalyst notifies and repeatedly reminds users that they may not download individual level data when they receive cloud credits, when they login, and when they request downloads. Monitoring of data egress adds another layer of security.
