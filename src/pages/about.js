            <Paragraph>
                For research investigators who need to find, access, share, store, cross-link, and compute on large scale data sets, NHLBI BioData Catalyst serves as a cloud-based ecosystem providing tools, applications, and workflows to enable these capabilities in secure workspaces. 
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                NHLBI BioData Catalyst increases access to NHLBI data sets and innovative data analysis capabilities and accelerates efficient biomedical research that drives discovery and scientific advancement, leading to novel diagnostic tools, therapeutic options, and prevention strategies for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders.

            <Paragraph>
                Though the primary goal of the BioData Catalyst project is to build a data science platform, at its core, this is a people-centric endeavor. BioData Catalyst is also building a community of practice working in parallel to collaboratively solve technical challenges.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                The BioData Catalyst ecosystem is funded by a flexible mechanism called Other Transactions (OT). The OT mechanism gives NHLBI considerable flexibility in making and managing awards. This is particularly important for the BioData Catalyst to stay nimble as it approaches the complex tasks involved in the development of this ecosystem under the ever-changing conditions of data science and biomedical science.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Currently, researchers and other professionals from the following institutions have received OTA funding from the NHLBI to work on the BioData Catalyst ecosystem:
