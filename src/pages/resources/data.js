            <Heading>How Data Access Works on BioData Catalyst</Heading>

            <Paragraph>
                The BioData Catalyst ecosystem manages access to the hosted controlled data using data access approvals
                from the NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (<ExternalLink to="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">dbGaP</ExternalLink>).
                Therefore, users who want to access one or more of the hosted controlled studies on the ecosystem must be approved for access to that study in dbGaP. 
            </Paragraph>
            
            <Paragraph>
                Users log into BioData Catalyst platforms with their eRA Commons credentials and authentication is performed by iTrust.

                    In addition, external collaborators will need to obtain DAR approval for those at their institutions.
