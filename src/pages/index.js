                            NHLBI BioData Catalyst is a cloud-based platform providing tools, applications, and workflows in secure workspaces.
                            By increasing access to NHLBI datasets and innovative data analysis capabilities,
                            BioData Catalyst accelerates efficient biomedical research that drives discovery and scientific advancement,
                            leading to novel diagnostic tools, therapeutics, and prevention strategies for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders.
