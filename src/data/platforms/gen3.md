teaser: The Gen3 software stack is a collection of microservices that enable the standing-up of data commons, which allows different partner organizations to pool data and grants-approved researchers access to harmonized datasets in a scalable, reproducible, and secure manner.
service: The Gen3 platform lets users search and filter over harmonized TOPMed variables and their value ranges, and export the selected cohorts to analytical workspaces. Gen3 also allows users to search over study-specific genomic and phenotypic data files broken down by consent groups, and discover new studies to apply for access through dbGaP.

- Private, secure, workspaces (projects) for running analyses at scale
- Collaboration features with the ability to set granular permissions on project members
- Directly access BDC without needing to set up a Google or AWS billing account
- Access to hosted TOPMed studies all in one place and the ability to analyze data on the cloud at scale
- Tools and features for performing multiple-variant and single-variant association studies including:
    + Annotation Explorer for variant aggregations
    + Cloud-optimized Genesis R package workflows in Common Workflow Language
+ Cohort creation by searching phenotype data
    + Use PIC-SURE API for searching phenotype data 
    + Search by known dbGaP identifiers
    + Rstudio and Jupyterlab Notebooks built directly into the platform for easy interactive analysis and manipulation of phenotype data
- Ability to analyze hosted TOPMed Data in combination with your own data on AWS or Google Cloud
- Billing and administrative controls to help your research funding go further - avoid forgotten instances, abort infinite loops, get usage breakdowns by project.
