- Private, secure, workspaces (projects) for running analyses at scale
- Collaboration features with the ability to set granular permissions on project members
- Directly access BDC without needing to set up a Google or AWS billing account
- Access to hosted TOPMed studies all in one place and the ability to analyze data on the cloud at scale
- Tools and features for performing multiple-variant and single-variant association studies including:
    + Annotation Explorer for variant aggregations
    + Cloud-optimized Genesis R package workflows in Common Workflow Language
+ Cohort creation by searching phenotype data
    + Use PIC-SURE API for searching phenotype data 
    + Search by known dbGaP identifiers
