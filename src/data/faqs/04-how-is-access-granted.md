title: How is access granted to controlled-access data in BioData Catalyst?
---

Access to data is controlled by the NHLBI Data Access Committee (DAC) utilizing the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) permissions infrastructure and the NHLBI Data Access Committee (DAC). In order to access controlled-access data in BioData Catalyst, a user must have an approved Data Access Request (DAR) in dbGaP (see also FAQs 8 and 9).  The role of the NHLBI DAC is to review and approve (or deny) investigator submitted DARs and to ensure investigator compliance with the NIH [Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/policies/).
