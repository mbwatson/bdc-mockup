title: Does BioData Catalyst enforce the requirement for IRB approval and other Data Use Limitatons?

Because BioData Catalyst uses the dbGaP permission infrastructure for controlling access to data, the same requirements for IRB approval or other Data Use Limitations are enforced. Should BioData Catalyst implement novel methods for requesting and approving access, these same requirements will be enforced.
