title: If my study has special requirements for access to data such as a Letter of Collaboration, will BioData Catalyst enforce this requirement?
---

Because BioData Catalyst uses dbGaP permission infrastructure for controlling access to data, any additional requirements for approval are enforced. Should BioData Catalyst implement novel methods for requesting and approving access, these same requirements will be enforced. Study PIs for studies with special requirements or especially sensitive data are encouraged to contact the NHLBI BioData Catalyst ([nhlbidatastage@mail.nih.gov](mailto:nhlbidatastage@mail.nih.gov)) and NHLBI DAC ([nhlbigeneticdata@mail.nih.gov](mailto:nhlbigeneticdata@mail.nih.gov)) project office teams to discuss any concerns.
