title: As a data submitter, do I need to do anything to move my data from dbGaP to BioData Catalyst? Do I need to submit another institutional certification?

No, dbGaP and BioData Catalyst staff will ensure data is safely available through BioData Catalyst. Pursuant to NIH policy on sharing of research data ([NOT-OD-03-032](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-03-032.html)) and the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy ([NOT-OD-14-124](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-14-124.html) and [NOT-OD-19-023](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-023.html)), the NHLBI has classified BioData Catalyst as an NIH-designated repository and so a new certification is not needed.
