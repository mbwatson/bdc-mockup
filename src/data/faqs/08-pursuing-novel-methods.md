title: Is the NHLBI pursuing novel methods of access to controlled-access data?
---

The NHLBI is pursuing data access processes and tools that could provide access to data in a more facile manner in compliance with NIH Policy and the [Genomic Data User Code of Conduct](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/Genomic_Data_User_Code_of_Conduct.pdf), participant informed consents, and with equivalent or better security than dbGaP.  The NHLBI aims to improve and streamline the data access process by applying technology to ease the burden on investigators and speed access while providing a secure environment with protections against misuse of data.
