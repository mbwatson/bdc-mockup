The NHLBI-supported DataSTAGE (Storage, Toolspace, Access and analytics for biG data Empowerment) ([www.nhlbidatastage.org](www.nhlbidatastage.org)) is a cloud-based infrastructure where heart, lung, blood, and sleep researchers can go to find, search, access, share, cross-link, and compute on large scale datasets.  It provides tools, applications, and workflows to enable those capabilities in secure workspaces.
