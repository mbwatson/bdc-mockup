title: How is data secured in BioData Catalyst?
---

BioData Catalyst operates on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Both AWS and GCP have received an Authority to Operate (ATO) from the General Services Administration FedRAMP ([www.fedramp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov)) following a rigorous assessment process by a third party assessor. The NHLBI Chief Information Officer has reviewed the System Security Plan from each system that comprises the BioData Catalyst environment and has issued an ATO for their system to operate at the Moderate level. This type of authorization is consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology guidance and complies with all requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act.
