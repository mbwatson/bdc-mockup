title: What are some of the novel methods of access that NHLBI is pursuing?
---

**Library Card/Data Passport**

The Library Card1 model is designed to streamline the process for requesting access to data by allowing an Institutional Signing Official to provide a general approval or authorization for an investigator to apply for data for a period of time, rather than having to approve multiple DARs. Investigators will still have to complete a DAR for each project, but the Library Card will give them pre-approval from their Institutional Signing Official.  Also, the DAR will still need to be approved by the DAC before access to data is given. The NHLBI is working with NHGRI and the Broad Institute to conduct pilots of the Library Card concept.

**Data Use Ontology System (DUOS)**

The Data Use Ontology System (DUOS) is an implementation of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use Ontology that supports machine readable encoding of Data Use Limitations (DUL) for a data set and the Research Use Statement within a DAR.

DUOS can facilitate and streamline the evaluation of data access requests and could potentially provide automated approval of access requests in cases where non-sensitive data is being requested. The NHLBI is experimenting with DUOS as a tool to support the NHLBI DAC.
